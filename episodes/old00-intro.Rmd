## What is EDA?

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a process of analyzing and summarizing a dataset in order to understand its main characteristics, such as the distribution of variables, the presence of outliers, and the relationship between different variables. 

In R, EDA typically involves using a combination of visual and quantitative methods to explore and summarize the data, such as creating histograms, scatter plots, and summary statistics, which can be done using a variety of R packages such as ggplot2 and dplyr.


## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files. Relative
paths indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to
absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working
this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and
share it with others without having to directly modify file paths in the
individual scripts.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it). The interface also
(optionally) preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to
resume work after a break.


### Create a new project

* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `New project`
* Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory") and choose a convenient
  location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the
  day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
* Click on `Create project`
* Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
  script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
  "`script.R`".

The simplest way to open an RStudio project once it has been created is to 
navigate through your files to where the project was saved and double
click on the `.Rproj` (blue cube) file. This will open RStudio and start your R
session in the **same** directory as the `.Rproj` file. All your data, plots and
scripts will now be relative to the project directory. RStudio projects have the
added benefit of allowing you to open multiple projects at the same time each
open to its own project directory. This allows you to keep multiple projects
open without them interfering with each other.



### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized and make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you might
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**. Here
are some examples of suggested directories:

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets.
   For the sake of transparency and 
   [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you
   should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
   your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible.
 - **`data_output/`** When you need to modify your raw data,
   it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets in a
   different folder.
 - **`documents/`** Used for outlines, drafts, and other
   text.
 - **`fig_output/`** This folder can store the graphics that are generated
   by your scripts.
 - **`scripts/`** A place to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting.

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory.

![Example of a working directory structure](../fig/rstudio_project_files.jpeg)

Not all projects needs the entire filestructure, but when analysing data, we 
strongly recommend that you have at least the `data` folder established as a 
place to store your original, raw, data.

#### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
where R will look for and save files. When you write code for your project, your
scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory
and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not the same as the location of your RStudio 
project, it is likely that you opened an R script or RMarkdown file **not** your
`.Rproj` file. You should close out of RStudio and open the `.Rproj` file by 
double clicking on the blue cube! 


## Is everything up to date?

After setting up our project, it is time to make sure our libraries are 
up to date.

Run the install.packages() functions on the libraries you are going to use.
In this case we are going to use the tidyverse packages, and the readxl package
to import data:
```{r eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")
```

## Getting the data

Getting the data can be the most time consuming part of any dataanalysis.

In this workshop, we are going to analyse flight data. You should already have
downloaded the data. Move the file to the `data` folder of your project.

If not, you will need to download the data, now:
```{r eval = F}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/R-EDA/main/data/flightdata.xlsx", 
              "data/flightdata.xlsx", mode = "wb")
```
