The aim of KUB-Datalab is to teach students, teachers and researchers
basic concepts, skills and tools for working with data so they can
get more done in less time. And with less pain.

This is the next step after an introduction to R for complete beginners. 
We assume that you have some knowledge of R, equivalent to the material
covered in our [introductory course](https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-intro/).

In this workshop we investigate a dataset together, and let our curiosity guide
us in analysing and visualizing the data, using both elementary statistical
methods and graphs.

Regardless of our curiosity the concepts covered on this site, will be covered.

## Getting Started

Our teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.
To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup.html)" tab to
download data to your computer and follow any installation instructions.

## Prerequisites

We are going to assume that you have some familiarity with R and
RStudio, equivalent to the topics covered in our introductory course,
[R for absolute beginners](https://kubdatalab.github.io/beginning-R/).
We are going to use the datamanipulation tools from the tidyverse
a lot - so please brush up on the pipe %>% if you have forgotten 
about it.
